# AI Image Overlay

There have already been cases of fake blog posts using AI generated headshots as avatars. These images are very realistic at first glance and are generally good enough to fool most users.

This idea proposes a browser extension that detects AI generated avatar images and applies a warning overlay or hides the image completely to flag to the site visitor that a fake avatar is being used.

# Welcome to the Idea Farm
_Ideas, yet to be developed._

This is the place where I plant my ideas to see if they grow. Over the years, I've had a few ideas for projects. Some are trivial, some ridiculous, some might even have potential. I don't know. I've never really had the time to develop them.

So, I've decided to plant them here, open sourced under the Apache 2.0 Licence, to see if anyone else wants to nurture them and let them bloom.

Feel free to fork this repo if you wish, even add your own ideas and send me a pull request if you want. But remember, by doing that, you are open sourcing your idea so you must be prepared to let them fly with little more than an attribution.

Please note, some of these are silly, some trivial and others pointless. I have no plans to filter out the dross. You get what you get.

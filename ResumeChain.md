# Resumé Chain

_A secure, trusted resumé. Seems like a good use for a blockchain_

From and original Facebook comment:

Wouldn't it be great if there was a standardised and secure digital resumé format where qualifications, experience, references, skills and peer votes on skills etc. could be stored online.

Much like LinkedIn, but with full audit history to prevent gaming of the system.

Candidates could then generate temporary reports that include the relevant records to share with HR departments. Likewise, HR departments could search anonymously for specific requirements and approach possible candidates.

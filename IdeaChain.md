It starts with an idea.

I have an idea. I think it's a good idea but I'm not sure.

Before I discuss it with anyone, I want to assert that it is my idea and protect it. A digital patent of sorts. 

So first things first. A block-chain for recording ideas. Maybe just basic text, maybe markdown or Evernote notes. Need to keep blocksize to a minimum so data should be a hash of the idea. Where to store that actual idea?

Important point is that it protects IP.

Initial stage, idea can be kept private until ready.

Second stage. I make idea public to other members of the chain. Allow others to vote on the idea (good or bad).

If it reaches a threshold of up-votes, make it eligible for: Sale/Purchase

- sell but receive a royalty on future earnings
- sell outright
- raise funds to develop the idea

Transactions in idea currency.
